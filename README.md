## ‚≠ê Introduction

This is a Chat Application that allows users to chat with each other in real time.
<br/>
In this Web Application, I used React.js, Sockets and Chat engine which allows complete customization of absolutely any part of the chat application.
- Users are able to create their seperate chat room.
- Users can invite new user by sharing their chat room link.
- Users are able to send images, files through this chat application.
- Users are able to rejoin the chat room once he/she join room as their data is stored in local storage, etc.
and more...
